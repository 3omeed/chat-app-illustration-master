## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned keeping on practice my CSS and HTML, this was my first intermediate challenge in my life, it was hard actually
the best part is the chat interface and how to make it responsive for small screens.

### Continued development

I want in the future to add JS code to this project to make it more dynamic and also want to add animation to the chat interface.
don't hesitate to leave your feedback and your comment on my project helping me improve its code.
